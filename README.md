# Calculator
A very simple web calculator made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What does it do:
- Use basic operations (+, -, *, /) with whole and floating point numbers. 
- Clear the display.
- Change your operation before inputting the second number.

## What it can't do:
- Delete any mis-clicked numbers.
- Display what was previously inputted.
- Allow use of keyboard.

## Notes
I am currently done with this project.

If I want to go back to it, these are the things I want to work on:
- Keyboard support
- Backspace button
- Visual of previously typed numbers and operations
- Expand display for really large numbers
- Change the results of dividing by 0
- Add a footer on the page
